  - registered users get a feed for
  - all users can filter this view for tags, or filter to show politicans or bills.
    and with bills can filter by date / recent activity, or perhaps weighted relevance
  - selecting a feed item brings up an interest panel
  - starring a feed item saves it in your interest profile
  c. Interest Panel
   - for a bill or person, brings up a view (modal?) showing their info
   - starring an item saves it in interest profile of user
  d. Interest Profile
   - contains menu for tags of interest (so does feed?)
